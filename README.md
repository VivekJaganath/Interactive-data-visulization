# interactive-data-Visualization

Python coding for covid-19 Visualization in Europe.

In the month of January 2020, most of the European countries were affected by
COVID-19. As there was not much information about COVID-19, for example
- how it was transmitted, what measures needed to be taken to stop itâ€˜s spread,
etc., it was very hard for the European governments to formalize an approach
to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In such a situation the German government
came up with many measures to counter COVID-19. In this project, we are comparing the response of Germany with its European counterparts in aspects such
as the closure of schools, home quarantine, tests, etc through visualization.
