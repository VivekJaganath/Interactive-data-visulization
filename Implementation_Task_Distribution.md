1) Data preparation 
    Task Split : All of us work on it, prepare the data needed for their visualizations

2) Indiviual visualizations for each of the below tasks

    * View information such as daily cases, new deaths, total cases, total deaths due to corona virus in European nations.  - **Seena**

    * View information such as travelling such as Travel Restrictions, Public transport restrictions, availability of travel options.  - **Vivek and Shreyas**

    * View information such as opening of public facilities such as schools, public transport, workplaces. - **Shashank and Guru**
 
3) Dashboard which combines each of visualizations and making it reactive. - Initial version by Guru, then led by Seena to integrate with other visualizations

From the initial dashboard, we need to find 3 details :
a) How can we merge different datasets
b) What is the date range we will restrict our visualizations to
